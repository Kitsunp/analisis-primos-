# Prime Number Formula Generator

This project implements a sophisticated system for generating and optimizing mathematical formulas capable of identifying prime numbers. It utilizes genetic algorithms, metaprogramming techniques, and symbolic mathematics to evolve increasingly effective formulas.

## Features

- FormulaGenerator: Creates random mathematical formulas
- GeneticAlgorithm: Evolves and optimizes the formulas
- Utility functions for formula evaluation and manipulation
- Dynamic operation generation
- Metaprogramming techniques for formula creation

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- SymPy
- NumPy

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prime-formula-generator.git
cd prime-formula-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the optimized prime formula generator:

```python
from prime_formula_generator import run_optimized_prime_formula

run_optimized_prime_formula(100)  # Generate and evaluate formulas for primes up to 100
```
